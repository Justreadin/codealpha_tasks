# Lyrical - AI Music Recommendation System

## Overview
Lyrical is an AI-powered music recommendation system that integrates advanced machine learning with full-stack development. Designed to deliver personalized music experiences, Lyrical provides song recommendations, trending music insights, playlist management, and an interactive chat feature. It is powered by **Spotify's dataset**, tracking user listening behavior to predict song preferences.

## Key Features
âœ… **Personalized Recommendations** â€“ AI-driven music suggestions based on user listening history.
âœ… **Multi-Device Optimization** â€“ Recommends music based on the user's device type.
âœ… **Trending Music** â€“ Displays trending songs dynamically.
âœ… **Smart Search** â€“ Find music with an intelligent search engine.
âœ… **Playlist Management** â€“ Users can create and manage their playlists.
âœ… **Interactive Chat System** â€“ Engage with an AI-powered chat assistant for music discovery.
âœ… **Real-Time API Responses** â€“ FastAPI backend ensures smooth interaction.
âœ… **Visually Stunning UI** â€“ Vue.js frontend with 3D animations and modern aesthetics.

## Tech Stack
- **Frontend:** Vue.js, TailwindCSS, Three.js (for 3D visuals)
- **Backend:** FastAPI, PostgreSQL, SQLAlchemy
- **Machine Learning:** Scikit-learn (Gradient Boosting Classifier)
- **Database:** PostgreSQL
- **Deployment:** Docker, Uvicorn, Nginx

## Installation and Setup

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+
- Node.js 16+
- PostgreSQL
- Vue.js (installed globally)

### Backend Setup
```sh
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/Justreadin/codealpha_task/Lyrical.git
cd Lyrical

# Create a virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Set up the database
python scripts/db_connection.py

# Train the model (optional if pre-trained model is available)
python scripts/train_model.py

# Run FastAPI
uvicorn api.recommendation_api:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 1200 --reload
```

### Frontend Setup
```sh
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

## API Endpoints
### Get Recommendations
**Endpoint:** `/recommend/{user_id}`

**Method:** `GET`

**Response:**
```json
{
  "user_id": "Windows 10",
  "recommended_tracks": ["Song A", "Song B"]
}
```

## Model Training Workflow

1. **Database Connection Setup**
   - Location: `scripts/db_connection.py`
   - Establishes a connection to PostgreSQL.

2. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Location: `scripts/data_preprocessing.py`
   - Cleans and prepares the dataset.

3. **Model Training**
   - Location: `scripts/train_model.py`
   - Trains a **Gradient Boosting Classifier** on user listening behavior.

4. **Saving the Model**
   - Location: `models/`
   - Saves the trained model using `joblib`.

5. **Serving the Model**
   - Location: `api/api.py`
   - Provides RESTful API endpoints for recommendations.

6. **Frontend Integration**
   - Location: `frontend/`
   - Builds the Vue.js application with search, playlists, and chat features.

## Next Steps
1. **Fine-tune the Machine Learning Model** â€“ Improve accuracy with additional features.
2. **Optimize API Performance** â€“ Reduce latency and increase scalability.
3. **Enhance UI/UX** â€“ Add more animations and make interactions seamless.
4. **Deploy on Cloud** â€“ Host on AWS/GCP/Azure with Dockerized containers.
5. **Implement User Authentication** â€“ Allow users to save preferences.
