i have a task to named music recommendation system:
Spotify's recommendation system powered by machine learning predicts a user's likelihood of repeatedly listenning to a song within a set timeframe. Using a dataset with 1 indicating repeated plays within a month, it tracks user song histories and timestamps to generate personalized song recommendation.

i need to do this project and i want it to be robust, give me the requirements and the steps before we begin each step

2. Database Connection Setup
Location: scripts/db_connection.py

Purpose: Establish database connections for loading data and querying recommendations.

Example Code:

python
Copy code
from sqlalchemy import create_engine

DATABASE_URL = "postgresql://username:password@localhost:5432/music_recommendation"
engine = create_engine(DATABASE_URL)

def get_db_engine():
    return engine
3. Data Preprocessing
Location: scripts/data_preprocessing.py

Purpose: Clean and prepare the data for model training.

Example Code:

python
Copy code
import pandas as pd

def clean_data(data_path):
    data = pd.read_json(data_path)
    # Drop duplicates, handle missing values
    data = data.dropna(subset=['track_name', 'artist_name'])
    data['played_at'] = pd.to_datetime(data['played_at'])
    return data

cleaned_data = clean_data("../data/spotify_million_playlist.json")
cleaned_data.to_csv("../data/cleaned_data.csv", index=False)
4. Model Training
Location: scripts/train_model.py

Purpose: Train machine learning models.

Example Code:

python
Copy code
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.ensemble import GradientBoostingClassifier

def train_model(data_path):
    data = pd.read_csv(data_path)
    X = data[['duration_ms', 'play_count']]
    y = data['repeat_play']

    X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)
    model = GradientBoostingClassifier()
    model.fit(X_train, y_train)

    return model

model = train_model("../data/cleaned_data.csv")
5. Saving Models
Location: models/

Save Model:

python
Copy code
import joblib

joblib.dump(model, "../models/music_recommendation_model.pkl")
6. API Code for Serving Recommendations
Location: api/recommendation_api.py

Purpose: Provide RESTful API endpoints using FastAPI.

Example Code:

python
Copy code
from fastapi import FastAPI
import joblib

app = FastAPI()
model = joblib.load("../models/music_recommendation_model.pkl")

@app.get("/recommend/{user_id}")
def recommend(user_id: int):
    # Mocked recommendation for simplicity
    return {"user_id": user_id, "recommended_tracks": ["Track A", "Track B"]}
7. Main Application
Location: main.py

Purpose: Run the entire application, including API, database setup, and data pipeline.

Example Code:

python
Copy code
import uvicorn

if __name__ == "__main__":
    uvicorn.run("api.recommendation_api:app", host="0.0.0.0", port=1200, reload=True)
Next Steps
Data Preparation: Load and preprocess the dataset.
Model Development: Train and evaluate models.
API Integration: Deploy the API.
Testing: Validate data flow and recommendation accuracy.
Deployment: Serve recommendations through API endpoints.
